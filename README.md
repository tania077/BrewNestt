## JavaScript Concepts Used

Perfect for beginners to study and explain in interviews:

1. **`IntersectionObserver`** — efficient scroll-based animations
2. **`classList.toggle/add/remove`** — dynamic CSS class manipulation
3. **`addEventListener`** — click, scroll, submit event handling
4. **`data-*` attributes** — used for menu category filtering
5. **`setTimeout`** — cart toast auto-dismiss and form feedback
6. **`event.preventDefault()`** — stop default form submission
7. **Template literals** — dynamic cart message content
8. **Modular functions** — `addToCart()`, `handleSubmit()` for reusability

---

## CSS Concepts Used

1. **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** — design tokens for colors, fonts, spacing
2. **CSS Grid & Flexbox** — responsive layout without any framework
3. **`clamp()`** — fluid typography that scales with viewport
4. **Media Queries** — mobile-first responsive breakpoints
5. **CSS Transitions & Animations** — hover effects, float animation, fade-in
6. **`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`** — interactive state styling
7. **`position: fixed`** — sticky navbar

---

## Sections

- **Navbar** — sticky, responsive, active link highlighting
- **Hero** — headline, CTA buttons, stats, floating cup card
- **About** — story, features, organic/fair-trade messaging
- **Menu** — filterable grid of 8 items with add-to-cart
- **Gallery** — CSS grid photo layout (placeholder-ready)
- **Testimonials** — customer reviews with featured card

---
